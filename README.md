# PasswordGenerator

The goal of this project is to create a password generator that will randomly generate a password for the user based on the user's inputs.

The site contains a "generate password" button that, when pressed, prompts the user to answer several questions to qualify the password's characteristics, and then creates a password that meets those criteria.
